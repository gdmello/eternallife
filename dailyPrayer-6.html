When Jesus had arrived there, they violently strip off his garments cleaving to his torn flesh, and cast him on the cross The divine Lamb stretches himself out on this bed of death, presents his hands to the executioners, and offers to the Eternal Father the great sacrifice of his life for the salvation of men. Behold, now they nail him to the cross and raise him on it. Look, my soul, on your Saviour, who, fastened by three hard nails, hangs from the cross, where he can find neither room nor rest At one time he leans on his hands, at another on his feet; but where he leans, there the pain is increased
O my Jesus! and what a bitter death is this which You die. I see written over the cross, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews (John 19:19). But except this title of scorn, what token do You show of being a king? Ah, indeed, this throne of tortures, these hands pierced with nails, this head transfixed, this flesh all torn, may well make You known for a king, but a king of love. I draw near, then, with tenderness, to kiss these wounded feet. I embrace this cross, where You, made a victim of love, would die a sacrifice for me. Ah, my Jesus, what would have become of me if You had not satisfied the divine justice? I thank You, and I love You.Whilst hanging on the cross, Jesus has no one who can console him. Among those who stand around him, some are blaspheming, some are deriding him; some say, If You are the Son of God, descend from the cross (Matt 27:40); others, He saved others, Himself He cannot save. And he receives no compassion even from those who are his very companions in punishment; nay, rather, one of them joins those others in blaspheming him: One of the thieves who were hanging with Him, blasphemed Him (Luke 23:39). There stood, it is true, below the cross, Mary assisting with love her dying Son. But the sight of this mother in her sorrows, so far from consoling Jesus, afflicted him so much the more, at seeing the pain which she endured for love of him. So, then, our Redeemer, finding no comfort here on earth, turned himself to the Eternal Father in heaven above. But the Father, seeing him covered with all the sins of mankind, for which he was making satisfaction, said, No, my Son, I cannot console You. It is must that even I too should abandon You to Your pains, and leave You to die without comfort. And then it was that Jesus cried out, My God, My God, why have You forsake n me? (Matt 27:46).Ah, my Jesus, how do I see You in pains and sorrow? Ah, too good reason have You for Your grief, to think that You are suffering in order to be loved by men, and yet that there should be found so few to love You. O sweet flames of love, which are consuming the life of a God, consume in me, I pray you, all earthly affections, and make me burn only with love for that Lord who was willing for love of me to lay down his life on an infamous gibbet. But You, O Lord, how could You die for me, foreseeing the injuries which I should afterwards do to You? Avenge Yourself, I pray You, now on me, but avenge Yourself for my salvation; grant to me such a sorrow that it shall always make me sorry for the vexations which I have given You. Come, scourges, thorns, nails, and cross, which are so grievously tormenting my Lord, come and wound my heart, and ever remind me of the love which he has borne to me. Save me, my Jesus, and let this saving be to give me the grace of loving You, - to love You and my own salvation."</p>

As if he had said, O men, all has been completed and done for your redemption. Love me, then, since I have nothing more that I can do to make you love me. My soul, look up at your Jesus who is now going to die. Look at those eyes growing dim, that face grown pale, that heart which is beating with languid pulse, that body which is now abandoning itself to death; and look at that beautiful soul which is just on the point of forsaking that sacred body. The heavens
are darkened, the earth trembles, the sepulchres are opened; signs that now the maker of the world is about to die. Lo, at last Jesus, after having commended his blessed soul to his Father, first giving a deep sigh from his afflicted heart, and then bowing his head in sign of the offering of his life which at this moment he renewed for our salvation, at length, by the violence of his sorrow, expires and renders up his spirit into the hand of his beloved Father. Approach up here, my soul, to this cross. Embrace the feet of your dead Saviour, and think that he is dead through the love which he bore toward you.Ah, my Jesus, to what has Your affection towards me reduced You? And who, more than I have enjoyed the fruits of Your death? Make me, I beseech You, understand what love that must have been that a God should die for me, to the end that from this day forth I may love none other than You. I love You, greatest Good; O true lover of my soul, into Your hands I commend my soul. I beseech You, by the merits of Your death, make me to die to all earthly loves, in order that I may love You alone, who are alone worthy of all my love. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me. Hail, Jesus, our Love, and Mary, our hope!"</p>
