						Jesus, the merciless violence of your executioners, the weight of the cross, or rather the more oppressive load of my sins, crush you to the earth. Panting for breath, exhausted as you are, you did not refuse to endure new tortures for me. Will I then refuse the light burden of your commandments; will I refuse to do violence to my perverse passions and sinful attachments; will I relapse into those very crimes for which I have shed false and delusive tears? O Jesus stretch your holy hand to my assistance, that I may never more fall into mortal sin; that I may at the hour of death secure my salvation. Amen.
