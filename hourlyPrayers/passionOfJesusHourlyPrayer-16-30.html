						At length, O Blessed Virgin, Mother of sorrow, you are permitted to embrace your beloved Son. But alas, the fruit of your immaculate womb is mangled into one continuous wound. Yes O Lord, the fury of the Jewish leaders has at length triumphed, yet we renew their barbarity crucifying you by our sins inflicting new wounds. Most afflicted Mother of my Redeemer, I ask you by the pains and torments you suffered because of salvation, to obtain for me by your powerful intercession, pardon for my sins and grace to sympathize with you and your Son's afflictions. As often as I appear at the Holy Sacrifice of the mass, let me embrace you my Jesus, in the bosom of my heart. May I worthily receive you as the sacred pledge of my salvation. Amen.
