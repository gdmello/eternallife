						O suffering Jesus to what excess did your impious executioners' cruelty proceed? Beholding you faint under the cross, apprehensive of your death before they could complete their bloody intentions, they compel Simon to carry the cross that you might expire on it in the most exquisite torture. Should I complain of their cruelty or the repugnance of Simon? Have I not again crucified you by my crimes? Have I not suffered with fretful impatience the light afflictions with which your mercy visited me? Inspire me now, my Jesus, to detest and deplore my sinful impatience, ungrateful murmurs, and let me with all my heart cheerfully accompany you to Mount Calvary; let me live in you and die in you. Amen.
