						Charitable Jesus, for my salvation you performed the painful journey of the cross. Let me follow the footsteps marked by you O gracious Redeemer, the paths which through the thorns of life conduct to the heavenly Jerusalem. Would that you were entombed in my heart, that being united to you, I might rise to a new life of grace and persevere to the end. Grant me in my last moments to receive your precious body, as the pledge of immortal life. Let my last words be Jesus and Mary, my last breath be united to your last breath on the cross, that with a lively faith, a firm hope, and ardent love, I may die with you and for you, that I may reign with you for ever and ever. Amen.
