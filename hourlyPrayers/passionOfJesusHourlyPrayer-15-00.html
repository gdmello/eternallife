						Suffering Son of God, I now behold you in the last convulsive pangs of death. Your veins opened, your sinews torn, your hands and feet bleeding. I acknowledge charitable Jesus, that my reiterated offenses have been your merciless executioners, the cause of your bitter sufferings and death. Yet God of mercy, look on my sinful soul, and bathe it in your precious blood. Let me die to the vanity of the world and renounce its false pleasures. You did pray my Jesus for your enemies. I forgive mine. I embrace them in the depths of your charity. I bury my resentment in your wounds. Shelter me in the day of wrath in the sanctuary of your side. Let me live, let me die, in my crucified Jesus.
