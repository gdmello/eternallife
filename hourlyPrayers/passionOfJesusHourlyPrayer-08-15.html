						Mary, I am the cause of your sufferings. O Refuge of Sinners let me participate in those heart-felt pangs which rent your tender soul, when you did behold your son trembling with cold, covered with wounds, fainting under the cross, more dead than alive. Mournful Mother, Fountain of Love, let me feel the force of your grief that I may weep with you, mingle my tears with your tears and your Son's blood. O suffering Jesus, by your bitter passion, and the heart-breaking compassion of your afflicted Mother, grant me the efficacious grace of perseverance. Mother of Jesus, intercede for me. Jesus, behold me with an eye of pity, and in the hour of my death receive me into the arms of your mercy. Amen.
