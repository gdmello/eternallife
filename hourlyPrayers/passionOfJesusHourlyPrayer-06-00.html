						Mangled victim of my sins, O suffering Jesus! I have deserved those bloody scourges, that cruel sentence of death, and yet, you did die for me that I should live for you. I am convinced that if I desire to please men, I cannot be your servant. Let me then displease the world and its vain admirers. I resign myself into your hands. Let love take possession of my heart. Let my eyes behold with contempt everything that could alienate my affections from you; let my ears be ever attentive to your word; let me through this painful journey accompany you. Jesus have mercy.
