						Meek and humble Jesus, my iniquity and perverseness loaded your shoulders with the heavy burden of the cross. Yet I flee even the appearance of mortification and everything which would check the violence of my passions and if I suffered, it was with a murmuring reluctance. I now, O Savior of the world detest my wrongs, and by your grace I am determined no more to offend you by my sins. Let me only glory in the cross of my Lord by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. Lay then on my stubborn neck the cross of true penance; let me for the love of you bear the adversities of this life, and cling inseparably to you in the bonds of perpetual love. Amen.
