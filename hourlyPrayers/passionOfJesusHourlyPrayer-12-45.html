						Suffering Jesus, I behold you stripped of your garments, your old wounds renewed, and new ones added. I behold you naked in the presence of thousands exposed to the inclemency of the weather, cold and trembling from head to foot, insulted by the blasphemous derision of the spectators. Strip, O mangled Lamb of God, my heart of attachments to the world and its deceitful affections. Protect my soul from its habits of sensual indulgence. Let me give up the cup of pleasure that I may dash it with contempt from my lips, and through Christian mortification arrive at your never fading glory. Amen.
