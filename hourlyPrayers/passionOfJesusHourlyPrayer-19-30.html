						O my Jesus, do you desire so ardently to give your life for us your miserable creatures? 
Ah! This desire inflames our hearts with a desire to suffer and die for the love of you, since you chose to suffer and die for the love of us. O beloved Redeemer, make known to us what you will from us. We desire to please you, to correspond at least in part to your great love for us. Increase always this blessed flame within us. May it make us forget the world and ourselves, that from this day forward we may think only of pleasing your enamored heart.
