						My Jesus, how many times I have daily nailed you to the cross by not believing that you are the Lord in all situations of my life. Please pardon me for all the wrong that I continue to do every moment of the day.  I pray that you may give me the mind of Christ so that I may be ever mindful of my thoughts, actions, choices and their impact on those around me.
