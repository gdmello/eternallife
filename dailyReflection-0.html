Under the old law, before the Word was made flesh, man might, so to speak, have doubted whether God loved him with a tender love; but after having seen him suffer a bloody and ignominious death for us on a cross of infamy we can no longer possibly doubt that he loves us with the utmost tenderness. And who will ever arrive at comprehending what was the excess of the love of the Son of God in being willing to pay the penalty of our sins? And yet this is ""of faith."" Truly He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. He was wounded for our iniquities; He was bruised for our sins (Isa 53:4,5). All this was the work of the great love which he bears us: He has loved us, and has washed us in His blood. In order to wash us from the defilements of our sins, he was willing to empty his veins of all his blood, to make of it for us, as it were, a bath of salvation. O infinite mercy! O infinite love of a God!Ah, my Redeemer, too surely have You obliged me to love You; too surely should I be ungrateful to You, if I did not love You with my whole heart. My Jesus, I have despised You, because I have lived in forgetfulness of Your love; but You have not forgotten me. I have turned my back on You; but You have come near to me. I have offended You, and You, have so many times forgiven me. I have returned to offend You; You have returned to pardon me. Ah, my Lord, by that affection with which You did love me on the cross, bind me tightly to You by the sweet chains of Your love; but bind me in such wise that I may nevermore see myself separated from You. I love You, O my chief good, and I desire to love You ever for the time to come."</p>

For it was not absolutely necessary in order to save us that Jesus should suffer so much and die for us; it were enough that he should pour forth but one drop of blood, should shed but one tear only for our salvation; this drop of blood, this tear shed by a Man-God, were sufficient to save a thousand worlds: but he willed to pour out all his blood, he willed to lose his life in a sea of sorrows and contempt, to make us understand the great love which he has for us, and to oblige us to love him. The charity of Christ urgeth us, says St. Paul (2 Cor 5:14). He says not the Passion or the death, but the love of Jesus Christ constrains us to love him.And what were we that You, O Lord, were willing at so great a price to purchase our love? Christ died for all, that they too who live should not now live to themselves, but to Him who died for them.’ Have You, then, my Jesus, died for us, that we might live wholly for You alone, and for Your love? But, my poor Lord (permit me so to call You), You art so full of love that You have suffered so much in order to be loved by men. But, after all, what is the number of those who love You? I see all these intent on loving, some their riches, some honors, some pleasures, some their relatives, some their friends, some, in fine, the beasts; but of those who truly love You, who alone are worthy of love, oh, how few such do I see! O God, how few they are! Among these few, nevertheless, I too desire to be, who at one time, just like the rest, offended You by loving filth; now, however, I love You above every other good. O my Jesus! the pain which You have suffered for me urgently obliges me to love You; but that which the more binds me to You and enkindles me to love You, is hearing of the love which You have shown in suffering so much, to the end that You may be loved by me. Yes, O my Lord, most worthy of love; You, through love, have givenYourself wholly to me; I, through love, give myself wholly to You. You for love of me did die; I for love of You am willing to die when and as it shall please You. Accept of my loving You, and help me by Your grace to do so worthily."</p>

St. Bonaventure says that the wounds of Jesus Christ, because they are wounds of love, are darts which wound hearts the most hard, are flames which set on fire souls the most cold: ""O wounds, wounding stony hearts, and inflaming frozen minds."" It is impossible that a soul which believes and thinks on the Passion of the Lord should offend him and not love him, no, rather that it should not run into a holy madness of love, at seeing a God, as it were, mad for love of us: ""We have seen,"" says St. Laurence Justinian, "" Wisdom infatuated by too muchlove.""  Hence it is that the Gentiles, as the Apostle says, when hearing him preach the Passion of Jesus crucified, thought it a folly: We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a scandal, but to the Gentiles foolishness (1 Cor 1:23). How is it possible (said they) that a God, almighty and most happy, such as he who is preached to us, could have been willing to die for his creatures?Ah, God enamoured of men! how is it possible (let us say this who by faith believe that he really died for love of us), — how is it possible that a goodness so great, that such a love, should remain so badly corresponded to by men? It is wont to be said that love is repaid with love; but Your love — with what manner of love can it be ever repaid? It would be necessary that another God should die for You, to make recompense for the love which You have borne towards us in dying for us. O cross, O wounds, O death of Jesus! you bind me closely to love him. O God, eternal and infinitely worthy of love, I love You, I desire to live only for You, only to please You; tell me what You will of me, and I will wholly  to do it. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
