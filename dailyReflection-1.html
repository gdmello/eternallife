He began, then, to feel a great fear and weariness of death, and of the pains which must accompany it. At that moment there were represented to his mind most vividly the scourges, the thorns, the nails, the cross, which then, not one after the other, but all together, came to afflict him; and specially there stood before him that desolate death which he must endure, abannoned by every comfort, human and divine; so that, terrified by the sight of the horrid apparatus of such torments and ignominies, he besought his Eternal Father to be freed from them: My Father, if it be possible let this chalice pass from Me (Matt 26:39). But how is this? Was it not this same Jesus who had so much desired to suffer and die for men, saying, I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished (Luke 12:50). How, then, does he fear these pains and this death? Nay, it was with good-will he was going to die for us: but to the end we might not suppose that through any virtue of his divinity he could die without pain, for this it was he made this prayer to his Father, to make us know that he not only died for love of us, but that the death he died was so tormenting as to terrify him greatly."</p>

But, Lord, to deliver Yourself from the death which men are preparing for You is in Your hands, if it so please You; why, then, afflict Yourself? Ah, it was not so much the torments of his Passion as our sins which afflicted the heart of our loving Saviour. He had come on earth to take away our sins; but then, seeing that, after all his Passion, there would yet be committed such iniquities in the world, this was the pain which before dying reduced him to death, and made him sweat living blood in such abundance that the ground all round about him was bathed therewith: And His sweat became as drops of blood running down on the earth (Luke 22:44). Yes, this is precisely what it was - because Jesus then saw before him all the sins which men were going to commit after his death, all the hatred, the impurities, thefts, blasphemies, sacrileges; and because then each sin, with its own malice, came like a cruel wild beast to rend his heart. So that he seemed to be saying, Is this, then, O men, the recompense which you make to my love? Ah, if I could see you grateful to me, with what gladness should I now go to die; but to see, after so many pains of mine, so many sins; after so great love, so great ingratitude, - this it is which causes me to sweat blood. Were they then my sins, my beloved Jesus, which in that hour so greatly afflicted You? If, then, I had sinned less, You would have suffered less. The more pleasure I have taken in offending You, so much the more horror I then caused You. How is it that I do not die of grief in thinking that I have repaid Your love by increasing Your pain and sorrow? Have I, then, afflicted that heart which has so much loved me? With creatures I have been grateful enough; with You only have I been ungrateful. My Jesus, pardon me; I repent with all my heart."</p>

He prostrated himself with his face on the earth, as ashamed to lift up his eyes to heaven, and lying in the agony of death he prayed a long time: Being in an agony, he prayed (Luke 22:43)At that time, my Lord, You did pray for me to the Eternal Father to pardon me, offering Yourself to die in satisfaction for my sins. O my soul, how is it that you do not surrender yourself to such great love? How, believing this, can you love anything else than Jesus? Come! cast yourself at the feet of your Saviour in his agony, and say to him, my dear Redeemer, how is it that You could love one who had so offended You? How could You suffer death for me, seeing my ingratitude? Make me, I pray You, partaker of this sorrow which You did feel in the garden. Now I abhor all my sins, and unite this abhorrence to that which You then had for them. O love of my Jesus, You art my love! Lord, I love You, and for love of You I offer myself to suffer every pain, any death. Ah, by the merits of the agony which You did suffer in the garden, give me holy perseverance! Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
