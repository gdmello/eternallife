This torment of the crowning was very painful to him, and was also the longest, since the pain of it was prolonged even till his death: and every time that the crown on his head came to be touched, the torture was always renewed.Ah, ungrateful thorns, what are you doing ? Is it thus that you torment your Creator? But what thorns? O my soul ! it was you, with your depraved consenting to sin, who wounded the head of your Lord.My dear Jesus, You are the king of heaven ; but now You have become the king of reproaches and sufferings. Behold what the love of Your little sheep has brought You. O my God ! I love You ; but, alas ! as long as I live I stand in peril of forsaking and denying You, my love, as I have done in time past. My Jesus, if You see that I would ever turn to offend You, let me, I
pray You, die now, since I hope to die in Your grace. Let me not, I beseech You, ever to lose You again ; by my faults I should worthily deserve this misfortune, but of a surety You deserve not to be abandoned anew by me. No, my Jesus, I desire nevermore to lose You."</p>

and spitting on Him, they gave Him blows (Matt 27:29; John 19:3) Ah, my Lord, to what art Thou reduced ? O God, if any one had chanced to pass that way, and had seen this man thus disfigured, covered with these purple rags, with this sceptre in his hand, with this crown on his head, thus derided and illtreated by this rabble, for what could he ever have accounted him but for a man the most infamous and wicked in all the world. Behold, then, the Son of God become the mockery of Jerusalem! Ah, my Jesus, if I look on Your body, I see nothing but wounds and blood. And within, in Your heart, I find nothing else but bitterness and anguish, which make You suffer the agonies of death. Ah, my God, who but infinite goodness, such as You are, could ever have humbled himself to suffer so much for his creatures ? - but creatures beloved of God, because You are God. These wounds which I see in You are all tokens of the love which You bear for us. Oh, if all men could have contemplated You in the condition in which on that day You were a spectacle of sorrow and reproach to all Jerusalem, who would not have been seized by love of You? Lord, I love You, and give myself wholly to You. Behold, my blood, my life, all I offer You. Behold me ready to suffer and die as it pleases You. And what can I deny to You who has not denied to me Your blood and life? Please accept the sacrifice which a miserable sinner makes of himself, who now loves You with all his heart."</p>

(John 19:5). As though he would say, Behold that man whom you have brought before my tribunal, accusing him of having pretended to make himself a king; behold, this fear is at an end. Now that you have reduced him, as you see, to such a state that but little life can remain in him, let him to go and die in his own house ; do not oblige me to condemn one innocent. But the Jews, being infuriated, as they had at first cried out in their frenzy, His blood be upon us, so now they cried out, "Crucify Him, Crucify him ..." Away, away with Him; crucify Him. But just as then Pilate was from the balcony showing Jesus to the people, so the Eternal Father from heaven was pointing out to us his Son, saying in like manner, Behold the man ! He who was promised by me as your Redeemer, and was by you so much desired; he who is my only Son, beloved by me even as myself. Behold him, for the love of you, become man, the most afflicted and despised among all men. Ah, meditate, on him, and love him.Ah, my God ! be it so that I look upon Your Son, and love him; but do You, too, look on him, and, by the merit of his sorrows and insults, pardon me all the offenses which I have done against You. His blood be upon us. Let the blood of this Man-God, who is Your Son, descend upon our souls, and obtain for us Your mercy. I repent, O infinite goodness, of having offended You, and I love You with all my heart. But You know my weakness ; help me ; O Lord, have pity on me. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
