A God bound? and for what? and by whom ? By his own very creatures. Angels of heaven, what say you to this ? And You, my Jesus, why cause Yourself to be bound?", "O King of kings" (mourns St. Bernard), "what have You to do with chains ?" What can the bonds of slaves and of the guilty have to do with You, the King of kings, and the Saint of saints? But if men dare to bind You, You who art Almighty, why do You not deliver and free Yourself from the torments which these barbarous men provide for You? Ah, but it is not these ropes which tie You. Your love towards us it is which binds You and condemns You to death.<br><br>II.<br>
Look, O man, says St. Bonaventure, how these men illtreat Jesus : one drags him, another pushes him, another binds him, another smites him. And look how Jesus, like to a gentle lamb, without resistance suffers himself to be led to the sacrifice. And you, disciples, what are you doing? Why do you not run up to rescue him out of the hands of his enemies ? Why at
least do you not accompany him to defend his innocence before his judges? Ah, my God, even his disciples too, at seeing him taken and bound, take to flight and abandon him: Then His disciples leaving Him all fled (Mark 14:50).O my Jesus, thus abandoned, who shall ever undertake Your defence, if these Your most dear disciples forsake You? But, alas ! to think that this injury ended not with Your Passion ! How many souls after having consecrated themselves to follow You, and after having received from You many special graces, have through some passion of vile interest, or human respect, or defiling pleasure, abandoned You! Unhappy me, of the number of these ungrateful ones am I. My Jesus, pardon me, for I wish nevermore to leave You. I love You, and desire sooner to lose my life than ever again to lose Your grace."</p>

When brought before Caiphas, Jesus was questioned by him about his disciples and his doctrine. Jesus answered that he had not spoken in private but in public, and that those very persons who were standing round him well knew what he had taught : I spoke openly to the world: . . . lo these know what I said (John 18:20,21). But at this answer one of the servants, treating him as if too bold, gave him a horrible blow on the cheek, saying to him, Is that how You answer the high-priest? O the patience of my Lord ! How did an answer so gentle deserve an insult so great in the presence of so many people and of the high-priest himself, who, instead of reproving this insolent servant, rather by his silence applauds him ?Ah, my Jesus, You did suffer all this to pay the penalty for those affronts which I in my rashness have done to You. My Love, I thank You for it. O Eternal Father, pardon me through the merits of Jesus. My Redeemer, I love You more than myself.<br><br>II.<br>
Next, the iniquitous high-priest asked him whether he were truly the Son of God. Jesus, through respect for the divine name, affirmed that this was the truth; and then Caiphas rent his clothes, saying that Jesus had blasphemed, and they all cried out that he was worthy of death: But they answering said, He is guilty of death (Matt 26:66).Yes, my Saviour, truly are You guilty of death, since You are bound to make satisfaction for me who am guilty of eternal death. But because You by Your death has acquired life for me, it is but just that I should spend my life wholly for You. I love You, and desire nothing else than to love You. And since You, who are the greatest of all kings, wert willing, through love of me, to be despised more than all men, I, for love of You, am willing to suffer every affront which can befall me. Give me, I pray You, strength to bear them through the merits of the insults done to You."</p>

The council of priests having declared Jesus Christ guilty of death, the rabble set itself to illtreat him all the night through with blows and kicks, and spitting on him as a man already declared infamous: Then did they spit in His face, and buffeted Him (Matt 26:67) And then they mocked Him, saying, Prophesy to us, O Christ, who it is that struck You.Ah, my dear Jesus, these buffet You, and spit in Your face, and You art silent ; and as a lamb without complaining You suffer all for us: As a lamb before the shearer He shall be dumb, and shall not open His mouth (Isa 53:7). But if these know You not, I confess You for my God and Lord, and protest that I well understand that how much You innocently suffer, it is all for love of me. I thank You for it, my Jesus, and love You with all my heart.<br><br>II.<br>
When day was come they led Jesus Christ to Pilate to have him condemned. Pilate, nevertheless, declared him innocent; but to rid himself of the Jews, who followed to make a tumult, he sent him to Herod, who, desiring to see some miracle through mere curiosity, began to question him about divine things. But Jesus, not willing to answer this wicked one, was silent and gave him no answer. Therefore this proud one offered him many insults, and especially made them clothe him as a mad-man in a white robe.Eternal wisdom! O my Jesus! there lacked only this other injury, that You should be treated as a fool. O God! that even I in time past should have, like Herod, thus despised You! Do not, I pray You, chastise me, as You did Herod, by depriving me of Your voice. Herod knew You not for what You are; but I confess You for my God: Herod repented not of having injured You; but I repent of it with all my heart: Herod loved You not; but I love You above everything. Ah, deny
me not the voice of Your inspirations. Tell me what You would have of me, for by Your grace I am willing to do all. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
