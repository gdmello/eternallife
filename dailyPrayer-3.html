The Jews, however, discovering that Pilate after thus punishing him wished to let him go free, - as indeed he had already sufficiently indicated, I will chastise Him therefore, and release Him; I will chastise Him therefore, and let Him go (Luke 23:16,22) - they bribed the executioners to scourge him to such a degree that lie might die under the torment. Enter, O my soul, into the judgment-hall of Pilate, made on this day the horrible theatre of the pain and ignominies of your Redeemer, and see how Jesus, when he had arrived there, of his own accord strips himself of his clothes (as was revealed to St. Bridget) and embraces the column; thereby giving to men a most clear testimony how voluntarily he submitted for their sake to pains the most unmerciful, and how much he loved them. Look how this innocent Lamb goes with head bent down, and, as if all blushing through modesty, awaits this great torment. Lo, how these barbarians, like rabid dogs, already fly at him! Behold there these pitiless executioners; look how among them one strikes his breast, another his shoulders, another his thighs, and another other parts of his body; even his sacred head and beautiful face escape not from the blows. Alas! already flows that divine blood from every part; already are the scourges saturated with blood, and the hands of the executioners, the column, and even the earth. O God! the smiters, no longer finding any whole part to strike, add wound to wound, and lacerate all over that most holy Flesh; And they have added to the grief of My wounds (Psalm 67:27). O my soul! How could you offend a God who was scourged for you? And You, my Jesus, how could You suffer so much for one so ungrateful? O wounds of Jesus! you are my hope. O my Jesus! You are the only love of my soul."</p>

The scourges chosen for this work were the most severe, and every blow made a wound. The strokes, besides, reached to many thousand; so that even the very bones of the sides of our Lord were laid bare, as was revealed to St. Bridget. In a word, such was the havoc they made that Pilate thought to be able to move even his enemies to compassion; wherefore he showed him to them on the balcony, saying, Behold the man (John 19:5). And well did the prophet Isaias foretell to us the pitiful state to which our Saviour was to be reduced by His scourging, saying that his flesh was to be all rent: He was bruised for our sins (Isaiah 53:5), and his blessed body to become like the body of one leprous - all sores: And we accounted Him one leprous. Ah, my Jesus, I thank You for Your great love. It grieves me that I too joined in scourging You. I curse all my sinful pleasures which cost You so much pain. Make me often remember, O Lord, the love which You have borne for me, to the end that I may love You, and never offend You any more. Alas, what a special hell should there be for me if, after having known Your love, and after You have so often forgiven me, I should miserably offend You afresh, and damn myself! Ah! this very love and pity would be for me another hell still more tormenting. No, my love, permit it not. I love You, O my highest Good. I love You with all my heart, and will love You forever."</p>

Forever blessed be Your infinite charity. What would have been my lot, my Jesus, if You had not made satisfaction for me? Oh that I had never offended You! But if by sinning I have despised Your love, now I have no other desire than to love You and to be loved by You. You have said that You love him who loves You. I love You above everything; I love You with my whole soul: do make me worthy of Your love. Yes, I hope that You have already pardoned me, and that at present You of Your goodness love me. Ah, my dear Redeemer, bind me ever more indissolubly to Your love: suffer me not to separate myself ever from You. Lo, I am all Yours; chastise me as You will, but permit me not to remain deprived of Your love. Make me to love You, and then dispose of me as it pleases You. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
