O my most innocent Saviour ! (laments St. Bernard) and what crime have
You committed, that You must be condemned to death ? ""What have You done, O most innocent Saviour, that You should be thus judged?"" But I well understand (replies the saint) the sin which You have committed: "Your sin is Your love." Your crime is the too great love which You have borne to us. This, rather than Pilate, condemns You to death.The unjust sentence is read; Jesus hears it, and altogether resigned accepts it, submitting himself to the will of the Eternal Father, which wills him to die, and to die on the cross, for our sins: He humbled Himself , made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross (Phil 2:8).Ah, my Jesus, if You who were innocent did accept death for love of me, I, a sinner, for love of You, accept my death in such time and manner as it shall please You."</p>

Jesus waits not for them to lay it on him, but of himself embraces it, kisses and lays it upon his wounded shoulders, saying, Come, my beloved cross, three-and-thirty years I have been going about seeking you; on you I desire to die for the love of my little flock.Ah, my Jesus ! what more could You possibly have done to lay on me the necessity of loving You? If one of my servants only had offered himself to die for me, surely he would have won my love ; and how, then, can I have lived so long a time without having loved You, knowing that You, my sovereign and only Lord, did die to pardon me ? I love You, O my chief Good, and because I love You I repent of having offended You."</p>

Go forth also, ye seraphim, from paradise, and come to accompany your Lord, who is going to the mount, to be there crucified.What a sight ! A God who goes to be crucified for men ! My soul, look, I pray you, on your Saviour, who goes to die for you. Look on him, how he goes with head bent down, with trembling knees, all torn with wounds and dripping with blood, with that bundle of thorns on his head, and with that load of wood on his shoulders. God ! he walks with such difficulty that it seems as if at every step he would breathe forth his soul. O Lamb of God ! (say you to him) where are You going? I go (he answers) to die for you. When you shall see me now dead, remember (he says to you) the love I bore towards you; remember it and love me. Ah, my Redeemer, how can I have lived for the past so forgetful of Your love ? O my sins ! you have caused bitterness to the heart of my Lord, the heart which has loved me so much. My Jesus, I repent of the wrong which I have done You; I thank You for the patience which You have shown me, and I love You. I love You with all my soul, and desire to love You alone. Remind me ever, I pray You, of the love You have borne me, so that I may nevermore forget to love You.Jesus Christ goes up Calvary, and invites us to follow him.Yes my Lord, You who are innocent goes before me with Your cross. Walk on, for I will not leave You. Give me that cross which You will, that I may embrace it, and with it I am willing to follow You even unto death. I wish to die together with You, who have died for me. You command me to love You and I desire nothing else than to love You. My Jesus, You are, and shalt ever be, my only Love. Assist me to be faithful to You. Mary, my hope, pray to Jesus for me."</p>
